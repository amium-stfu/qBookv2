# Signal Help

## Widget Type

`Signal`

## Overview

The Signal widget displays a bound runtime signal and supports typed editing, bool toggling, bit toggling, and interaction-rule-based actions.
It can also react visually to Monitor rule states through widget-level visual rules.

## Properties

### TargetPath

Defines the signal target path to resolve.

### TargetPropertyPath

Stores the displayed property. Normal Signal widget editing keeps this field hidden and defaults it to `read` when the target exposes a `read` property.

### TargetPropertyFormat

Controls display formatting.

### Unit

Optional unit override for the displayed value.

### InteractionRules

Defines additional click-based behavior such as open editor, set value, toggle bool, open or close `DialogWidget` overlays, or invoke Python functions.

### VisualRules

Defines Monitor-driven visual state overrides for the signal body background.
Version 1 exposes only `BodyBackColor` with `None` or `Blink` while the referenced Monitor rule is active.

### IsReadOnly

Blocks input actions when enabled.

## Functions and Behavior

### Open value dialog

The widget can open the shared value input editor for writable targets.
The body click area remains available when the displayed value is empty.

### Target writeback

The target picker selects an item path, not a property path. When a target item exposes a `write` property, user input is written to `write` automatically while the widget continues to display the selected property, typically `read`. Targets without a `write` property fall back to writing the displayed `read` value.

### Toggle bits

Bit-oriented property presentations can route user actions to bit toggling logic.

### Send bool input

Bool-oriented UI choices can send direct input values.

### Execute interactions

The widget can execute configured interaction rules for body and sub-control actions.
`OpenDialog` and `CloseDialog` accept a dialog `Screen` id from the current folder and show or hide the matching internal overlay.

### Apply visual rules

The Action tab also exposes a `Visual` section.
When a referenced Monitor rule runtime path becomes active, the widget can override `BodyBackColor` and optionally blink until the rule clears.

### Respect editor mode

The widget suppresses runtime interaction behavior when edit mode is active.

## Runtime Notes

Signal behavior builds on the shared target binding and property presentation infrastructure defined in the item model and property control.
